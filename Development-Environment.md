This repository has only been tested with the following setup:

- [Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS (Xenial Xerus)](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/XenialXerus/ReleaseNotes)
- [ROS Kinetic Kame](http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu) (install ros-kinetic-desktop-full unless you are working on a headless server)

These instruction should work even if you are using some form of virtualization, though Gazebo will likely run slow.
