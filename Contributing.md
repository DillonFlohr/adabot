# **Contributing to the Wiki**
Keeping the wiki as up-to-date as possible is probably one of the most important tasks of anyone on this project. Documentation here will allow the future generations of students to more quickly take the torch and make this research successful.
## Tools
- Atom - Githubs code editor. It is very handy as it supports the markdown syntax and even has a Preview feature activated with the shortcut *Ctrl+Shift+M*
